# Minimum viable TYPO3 Distribution

The idea of this distribution is to provide only a basic
setup, but one that enables some features of TYPO3
and TYPO3 Console that enables a pleasant workflow.

I would recommend to build things on top of it,
but not remove anything from it, unless TYPO3 or TYPO3 Console
changes some defaults.

## Installation

### For a distribution that pre-sets TYPO3 7LTS
`composer create-project helhum/minimal-typo3-distribution new-project ^7`

### For a distribution that pre-sets TYPO3 8LTS
`composer create-project helhum/minimal-typo3-distribution new-project ^8`
